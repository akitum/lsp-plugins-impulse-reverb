		"name": "Impulse Reverb",
		"description": "This plugin performs highly optimized real time zero-latency convolution\nto the input signal. It can be used as a cabinet emulator, some sort of\nequalizer or as a reverb simulation plugin. All what is needed is audio\nfile(s) with impulse response taken from the linear system (cabinet, equalizer\nor hall/room). The flexible configuration allows to use True Reverb processing."
